# Ant Colony Optimization with Cartopy Visualization

## Description
This project implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve optimization problems using a nature-inspired metaheuristic approach based on the foraging behavior of ants. The project features visualization using cartopy to represent geographic and geospatial routes or other relevant data, making it suitable for optimization tasks with geographic contexts, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or network routing.

## Features
- Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm: Simulates ant behaviors to explore and optimize paths.
- Geospatial Visualization: Uses cartopy for mapping and visualizing paths on geographic scales.
- Pheromone Dynamics: Models the deposit and evaporation of pheromones, guiding ants to optimal paths.
- Flexible Configuration: Customizable parameters such as the number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, and alpha/beta influences.
- Interactive Exploration: Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing step-by-step execution, visualization, and parameter tweaking.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The required dependencies for this project are:
numpy,
matplotlib,
cartopy

## Running the Project
Customize parameters such as:
- Number of ants
- Pheromone evaporation rate
- Alpha and Beta parameters controlling the balance between pheromone influence and heuristic desirability.
- Observe the results, including geospatial visualizations generated by cartopy.

## Example Scenarios
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Optimize routes between a set of geographic locations, minimizing the total distance.
- Network Routing: Visualize and optimize routes within a network.
- Geospatial Mapping: Customize the problem space for real-world geospatial data and observe the optimization process.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language for the implementation.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running and visualizing the algorithm.
- numpy: Efficient array operations and computations.
- matplotlib: Basic visualization and plotting support.
- cartopy: Advanced geospatial mapping and projection capabilities.
